 ? WHAT CAN pCHART DO FOR YOU? ????????????????????????????????????????????????

  pChart is a PHP framework that will help you to create anti-aliased charts or
  pictures directly  from your web  server. You can  then display the result in
  the client browser, sent it by mail or insert it into PDFs. 

  This library  has now reached  an important  point  in its  development cycle
  going out of the beta step. pChart 2.0 is a completly rewritten library based
  on what I've learned doing the first version.

 ? PREREQUiSiTES ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

  This library has been written to work with PHP 5+ versions. It will also work
  with PHP 4 but the rendering quality maybe downgraded and the rendering speed
  seriously impacted.

  pChart require the GD and FreeType PHP extensions to be installed on your
  web server. This is an important prerequiste that can't be overrided.  


 ? RUNNiNG THE EXAMPLES ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????

  pChart is  shipped with  examples (located  in the /examples folder) that you
  can either render from a web page using your http and pointing to this folder
  or from the command line invoking the php interpreter.

  On windows OS,  assuming that  your PHP binaries  are correctly configured in
  the PATH  environment variable  you can  also execute  the BuildAll.cmd batch
  file.


 ? LiCENSE ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

  The  pChart library  is  released  under  two  different  licenses.  If  your
  application is not a  commercial one (eg: you make no money by redistributing
  it) then the GNU GPLv3 license (General Public License) applies. This license
  allows you to  freely integrate this library in your applications, modify the
  code and redistribute it  in bundled packages  as long as your application is
  also distributed with the GPL license. 

  The GPLv3 license description can be found in GPLv3.txt.

  If your  application can't  meet the GPL  license or is a commercial one (eg:
  the library is  integrated in a software or an appliance you're selling) then
  you'll have to buy a commercial  license. With this license you don't need to
  make publicly available your application code under the GPL license terms.

  Commercial license price are depending of your needs.
