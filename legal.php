                    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the http://homeworkhunt.com/ website (the "Service") operated by Isaiah Turner ("Homework Hunt", "us", "we", or "our").</p>

                    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

                    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

                    <p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>

                    <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>

                    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>

                    <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Stuff & Your Permissions</strong></p>

                    <p>When you use our Services, you may provide us with things like your files and/or content ("Your Stuff"). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p>

                    <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like document previews, editing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.</p>

                    <p>Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.</p>

                    <p><strong>Our Data Collection & Retention Policy</strong></p>

                    <p>When you visit our website we collect visitor information. We use analytics to understand who visits our website, how they got there, and what they did while they were there.</p>

                    <p>When you sign up for an account we collect your name, email address, and a hashed version of your IP address. Your password is also stored and secured by our state of the art hash algorithm.</p>

                    <p>When you search our site, we collect anonymized information on your search query.</p>

                    <p><strong>Our Legal Request Policy</strong></p>

                    <p>Should it ever become necessary to respond to a legal request, we will do so. We will always strive to both protect our users and uphold the law of the land.</p>

                    <p>We would only respond to a legally binding request. This means that the request would have to come from a United States federal, state, or local authority.</p>

                    <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>

                    <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Homework Hunt.</p>

                    <p>Homework Hunt has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Homework Hunt shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

                    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
